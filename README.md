# Instructions
## Frontend React and Vite
First download Node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/download.
Change directories into where you want your project
`cd path/to/where/you/want/you./project`
Then run `npx create-vite`
- When prompted, type `y` to continue
- Choose `React` and select `JavaScript`
- Enter a project name

Change directories to your new file `cd your-project-name` and install dependencies `npm install` and `npm install axios`

Now replace your `src` folder's `App.css` and `App.jsx` with this repo's.

Now you are ready to run it, `npm run dev` it will provide a link to http://localhost:5173/ where you can see the frontend.

## Backend Flask and Python
Create and activate virtual environment
`cd path/to/backend/folder`
`python -m venv venv`
`.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

Once the virtual environment is activated, copy over the files under this repo's algorithms into your folder.
then run `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` and `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Lastly, run the flask_app.py, `python flask_app.py`, all the backend stuff with happen at http://localhost:8080/api
